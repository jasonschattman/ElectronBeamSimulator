This Python application simulates an electron beam that's accelerating towards a large positive charge (the "anode") while being deflected by a small charged particle (called the deflector particle) that the user can drag around with the mouse.  

The physics behind the program is based on Coloumb's Law and Newton's Laws.  

In addition to controling the position of the deflector, you can use slider bars to adjust:

1.  The charge of the anode, from 0 up to 50000 units.  This determines how strongly the electrons are attracted towards the anode.
2.  The charge of the deflector particle, from -1000 up to 1000.  The electrons are attracted to the deflector if it's positively charged and repelled by it if it's negatively charged.  Setting this to 0 is a useful way to test the effects of the other settings on the beam.
3.  The flow rate of the electron beam, from 0 up to 20 electrons per second.  0 means the beam is off.
4.  The radius of the anode.  When an electron strikes the anode, it is absorbed and disappears from the simulation.  By shrinking the anode, you can get the electrons to go into orbit around it!

Using the mouse, you can drag the deflector particle, the anode, and the cathode (electron source).

Using a button, you can also clear all electrons from the screen.  This option is especially useful when the electrons are in chaos and you want to start over, or when you've gotten the deflector, cathode and anode to exactly where you want them and want to see what they do to a new beam.  

By setting the options in clever ways, you can create some amazing looping patterns, whereby the electrons go into funny-shaped orbits around the anode and deflector particle, like a juggler juggling 1000 balls at once.  

Once you've got a cool pattern going, try nudging one of the settings just a tiny bit (e.g. increase the anode charge by 1000) and watch the whole pattern collapse, then slowly settle into a totally new pattern!
